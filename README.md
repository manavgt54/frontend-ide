# Adaptive System - IDE Frontend Integration

This `README.md` describes the integration of the **Adaptive System** (formerly BMAD) backend with the IDE frontend chatbot agent. This integration is currently **in progress**.

## Overview

The Adaptive System acts as the robust multi-agent backend, orchestrating AI agents to generate software projects. The IDE frontend provides a chatbot interface that will communicate with the Adaptive System backend to:

- Receive user prompts for software development tasks.
- Display real-time progress of agent execution.
- Present generated files and documentation.
- Allow interaction with various agent modes.

## Connection Mechanism

The IDE frontend chatbot agent will connect to the Adaptive System backend via its exposed API endpoints. This will enable a seamless flow of information, allowing users to initiate, monitor, and manage their software development projects directly from the IDE.

## Chatbot Mode and Agent Interaction

The Adaptive System's various agents (e.g., Orchestrator, Analyst, Architect, Developer) will power the chatbot mode in the IDE. Users will be able to interact with these agents through the chatbot interface, providing requirements and receiving updates and outputs.

## Current Status

This integration is actively under development, and we are working to establish robust communication channels and a rich user experience within the IDE environment. Further updates will be provided as development progresses.
